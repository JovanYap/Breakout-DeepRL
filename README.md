# DeepRL-Breakout-Atari
 This project was created by my teammates and I using Deep Reinforcement Learning to train Deep Q Network agent to play the atari breakout game and learn from interacting with the environment as rewards is assigned to each action. 

 ## Methodology
 - Deep Q-learning and Deep Q Networks
 - Markov Decision Process
 - Epsilon Greedy Strategy 
 - Exploitation vs exploration
 ![Methodology](Methodology.png)
  
## Usage
- Tensorflow was used to train the agent
- Install the necessary packages as seen in the code
- Open and run the code in a jupyter notebook and you should get something as seen below
